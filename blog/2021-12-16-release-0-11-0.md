## Faster startup

This release includes a number of startup optimizations, including:

- The plugin manager instantiates plugins in parallel.

- The connection manager uses file modified time instead of filehash to detect connection changes.

- When multiple connections share a schema, we only fetch it once.

The first time you run `steamipe query` you'll see an immediate difference. 

<img src="/images/blog/2021-12-16-release-0-11-0/v10-v11-startup-comparison.gif" />

<br />

In v0.10 we achieved major gains by spawning database connections to run controls in parallel, and by enabling those parallel controls to share a common plugin-managed cache. 

v0.11 brings two additional optimizations that benefit control runs. First, we now only create prepared statements for controls that interpolate parameters into SQL statements. When controls use non-parameterized SQL statements, we avoid that overhead. Second, we avoid fetching the database schema for non-interactive query execution. 

Here's the difference for a single control run.

v10:

```
time steampipe check control.cis_v140_1_1
4.44s
```

v11:

```
time steampipe check control.cis_v140_1_1
3.08s
```
## Composable mods

In v0.11 you can build mods that use queries, controls, and benchmarks defined in other mods. The new `mod install` command enables that scenario. 

For example, let's build a custom mod that derives benchmarks from [AWS Compliance](https://hub.steampipe.io/mods/turbot/aws_compliance) and [Github Sherlock](https://hub.steampipe.io/mods/turbot/github_sherlock), and also extends GitHub Sherlock with a new control.

We'll use the the directory `mod_acme` for this example. First, install two mods like so.

```
steampipe mod install github.com/turbot/steampipe-mod-aws-compliance
```

```
steampipe mod install github.com/turbot/steampipe-mod-github-sherlock
```

This creates `mod.sp`.

```hcl
mod "local" {
  title = "mod_acme"
  require {
    mod "github.com/turbot/steampipe-mod-aws-compliance" {
      version = "latest"
    }
    mod "github.com/turbot/steampipe-mod-github-sherlock" {
      version = "latest"
    }
  }
}
```

```
steampipe mod list

local
├── github.com/turbot/steampipe-mod-aws-compliance@v0.22
└── github.com/turbot/steampipe-mod-github-sherlock@v0.5
```

Now we'll do three things in a separate new file, `acme.sp`.

1. Create a version of `aws_compliance` that cherrypicks just sections 1, 2, and 3 from `cis_v140`.

2. Create a version of `github_sherlock` that cherrypicks two of its four benchmarks.

3. Add a semantic versioning check to our own version of `github_sherlock`.

```sql
benchmark "acme_cis_v140" {
  title         = "ACME CIS v1.4.0"
  description   = "Only sections 1, 2, and 3."
  children = [
    aws_compliance.benchmark.cis_v140_1,
    aws_compliance.benchmark.cis_v140_2,
    aws_compliance.benchmark.cis_v140_3
  ]
}

benchmark "acme_github_sherlock" {
  title         = "Only issue_best_practices and private_repo, plus a new semver control."
  children = [
    github_sherlock.benchmark.issue_best_practices,
    github_sherlock.benchmark.private_repo_best_practices,
    control.repo_uses_semantic_versioning
  ]
}

control "repo_uses_semantic_versioning" {
  title = "Repo uses semantic versioning"
  sql = <<EOT
    select
      r.html_url || '@' || t.name as resource,
      case
        when t.name ~ '^v[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+$' then 'ok'
        when t.name ~ '^v[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+' then 'info'
        else 'alarm'
      end as status,
      r.full_name || '@' || t.name as reason,
      r.full_name
    from
      github_my_repository as r,
      github_tag as t
    where
      r.full_name = t.repository_full_name
      and r.full_name ~ 'turbotio/steampipe'
    order by
      r.full_name
  EOT
}
```

With this code in place, here are some checks you can run.

```
steampipe check all # run only these benchmarks/controls
```


```
steampipe check benchmark.acme_cis_v140 # just cis_v140 sections 1, 2, 3
```

```
steampipe check benchmark.acme_github_sherlock # 2 of 4 from github_sherlock plus semver
```

```
steampipe check control.repo_uses_semantic_versioning # just the semver check
```

To recap: the new `mod install` command serves the special case where you want to create your own mod to define benchmarks that remix, and perhaps extend, benchmarks and controls provided by existing mods.

## New plugins

Since our [last release](https://steampipe.io/blog/release-0-10-0), we've added 4 new plugins:

- [Keycloak](https://hub.steampipe.io/plugins/theapsgroup/) - query clients, identity providers, users, groups
- [Splunk](https://hub.steampipe.io/plugins/turbot/splunk) - query apps, indexes, users, searches
- [Steampipe Cloud](https://hub.steampipe.io/plugins/turbot/steampipecloud/tables) - query logs, users, workspaces, etc.
- [Terraform](https://hub.steampipe.io/plugins/turbot/terraform) - query resources in your Terraform files

We are always improving the suite of plugins. Highlights during this cycle: 8 new tables added to [GitHub](https://hub.steampipe.io/plugins/turbot/github), 7 new tables added to [Cloudflare](https://hub.steampipe.io/plugins/turbot/cloudflare), OIDC authentication support for [Kubernetes](https://hub.steampipe.io/plugins/turbot/kubernetes).

## Major mod updates

During this cycle we added 15 new benchmarks, comprising 192 controls, to the [NIST CSF](https://hub.steampipe.io/mods/turbot/aws_compliance/controls/benchmark.nist_csf) benchmarks.

## Let’s get building!

Steampipe delivers tools to build, execute and share cloud configuration, compliance, and security frameworks using SQL, HCL and a little elbow grease. To support those tools, it maps a growing suite of APIs to tables that you can query, and join across, in Postgres. 

Do you want to help us expand the open source documentation and control coverage for CIS, PCI, HIPAA, and NIST? Add tables to existing plugins? Create plugins to bring new APIs into the mix? The best way to get started is to [join our  Slack workspace](https://steampipe.io/community/join) and raise your hand. We would love to talk to you!
