# Controls
Running queries interactively is a powerful way to explore your resources and answer adhoc questions of your cloud configuration, but often we know the exact question we would like answered (e.g. are all my cloud storage buckets private?). In those situations, we simply want to check if our currently deployed resources meet a pre-defined condition, [Steampipe controls](/docs/using-steampipe/running-controls) (new in v0.5.0) allow you to do just that.  To run a `control` we use the new CLI action `check`:

<div className="row mb-5 mt-5"> 
  <div className="col col-0 col-lg-1"></div>
  <div className="col col-12 col-lg-9">
    <Terminal title="bash">
      <TerminalCommand withPrompt={false} enableCopyToClipboard={false}>
        {`
$ steampipe check all
        `}
      </TerminalCommand>
      <TerminalResult>
    {`
⠏ Running 63 controls. (10 complete, 53 pending, 0 errors): executing...
    `}
      </TerminalResult>
    </Terminal>
  </div>
</div>


### Define a custom control

The evaluation logic for a `control` is (of course) SQL. In fact, controls are built from named queries that adhere to a simple interface.  The required elements of the control query are:

* `resource`: a short resource identifying name/id
* `status`: the evaluated current status for the resource [`ok`, `alarm`, `error`, `info`, `skip`]
* `reason`: a description of the reason for the current status.

Queries can also return optional results called `dimensions`. Dimensions are metadata that can be returned from a control query to provide additional context for a given resource (i.e. `region` and `account` are common dimensions for AWS resources).

Controls are named and defined using a domain specific HCL syntax: 

<div className="row mb-4 mt-4"> 
  <div className="col col-0 col-lg-1"></div>
  <div className="col col-12 col-lg-9">
    <Terminal title="my_controls.sp">
      <TerminalCommand withPrompt={false} enableCopyToClipboard={false}>
        {`
control "bucket_versioning" {
  title = "S3 buckets should have versioning enabled."
  sql   = <<EOT
    select
      arn as resource,
      case
        when versioning_enabled then 'ok'
        else 'alarm'
      end status,
      name || ' versioning is ' || versioning_enabled || '.' as reason,
      region,
      account_id
    from
      aws_s3_bucket
    EOT
}
        `}
      </TerminalCommand>
    </Terminal>
  </div>
</div>

Multiple controls can be defined in a single `.sp` file. All `.sp` files in the current workspace are loaded when the CLI (or service) are running, and named controls can be run with the `steampipe check {control-name}` command (see above).

The SQL query can be included inline (as above) or it can be a reference to a `named query` in the same `workspace` ([additional info on named queries and workspaces](/blog/release-0-4-0)).

Our control returns a single row for each bucket, with a `status` of `skip` if the bucket does not have the “env”:”prod” tag, `ok` if tagged and versioning is enabled and `alarm` if prod with no versioning.

# CIS, PCI and Custom Benchmarks

Manually running many individual controls would be tedious and time consuming. Benchmarks are used to organize controls into hierarchies for aggregation and reporting; these collections of controls can then be run with a single command.


In our example above we see the power of organizing controls into a hierarchy.  Steampipe automatically aggregates the subtotals for each level of control hierarchy in the benchmark, providing a birds eye view of your current compliance state. 

### Open source benchmarks for AWS, Azure & GCP

To show off the power of `mods` to codify compliance and security controls, [the Turbot team](https://github.com/turbot) has built out a series of compliance mods for AWS, GCP and Azure that include Center for Internet Security (CIS) and PCI DSS benchmarks.

At launch, these mods define 200+ controls as code, covering the most common cloud environment misconfigurations (encryption, public access, networking and identity management). These controls are [fully documented](https://hub.steampipe.io/mods/turbot/aws_compliance), annotated and [ready for download](https://github.com/turbot/steampipe-mod-aws-compliance). Installing these benchmarks is as simple as cloning a repository:

<div className="row mb-5 mt-5"> 
  <div className="col col-0 col-lg-1"></div>
  <div className="col col-12 col-md-9">
    <Terminal title="steampipe cli">
      <TerminalCommand withPrompt={false} enableCopyToClipboard={false}>
        {`
$ steampipe plugin install aws
 
$ git clone https://github.com/turbot/steampipe-mod-aws-compliance.git
 
$ cd steampipe-mod-aws-compliance
 
$ steampipe check all
 
⠏ Running 63 controls. (10 complete, 53 pending, 0 errors): executing...
        `}
      </TerminalCommand>
    </Terminal>
  </div>

# The Steampipe Hub

A Steampipe **mod** is a collection of related Steampipe resources such as queries, controls, and benchmarks. Steampipe mods are defined using HCL, SQL and Markdown, and are distributed as simple text files. These files are designed to be portable, and version controlled via git. [The Steampipe Hub](https://hub.steampipe.io/mods) provides a central place to discover and document mods shared from any public git repository.

Mods can be discovered and examined in the Steampipe Hub. The Hub uses introspection, metadata and markdown docs from the mod repository to allow searching, and browsing of mod resources. Here is an example from the excellent AWS compliance mod:

<img width="100%" src="/images/blog/2021-05-20/hub_controls.png" />

The folder structure for a given mod should define a complete steampipe workspace. You can simply `cd` into the directory and run `steampipe check all` to immediately run all defined benchmarks and controls in the mod.

Installing an existing published mod to your local machine is accomplished by cloning a repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/turbot/steampipe-mod-aws-compliance.git
```

The Steampipe Hub and the mod repositories are deeply integrated.  The hub uses introspection of the mod metadata to allow for killer search, hierarchical browsing of controls and deep links between controls, queries and the source files in the repository.

# Let’s get building!

Steampipe now delivers a full suite of tools to build, execute and share cloud configuration, compliance, and security frameworks using SQL, HCL and a little elbow grease! We would love your help to expand the open source documentation and control coverage for CIS, PCI, HIPAA, NIST… and the best way to get started is to [join our new Slack workspace](https://steampipe.io/community/join) and raise your hand; we would love to talk to you!
